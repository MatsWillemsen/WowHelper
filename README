In order to get this to work you need to have python installed (Which you most likely already have).

I use 2.7.2, so it has only been tested on that version.

You also need to install atomac using:

  easy_install atomac

Besides that, just see the testscript.py and the internals of wowhelper.py to see what you can do.
Basic functionality is added:

sendKeys(keys) -- Directly send keys to the app. You can enter multiple keys here
sendAfter(seconds,keys) 
-- Same as above, but waits the amount of seconds and checks if there's any mouse movement in that time period. 
-- This is to avoid breaking ToS, and making it a one-to-one action.

click(x,y) -- Clicks the left mouse button on the position. It is very trivial adding other buttons.

You can use these functions after initiating the WowHelper class (see testscript.py)
